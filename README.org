* nvim-256noir

/The perfect colorscheme for when you've seen too many colors./

Is this just black and white? Mostly. For the minimalist who thinks other minimal themes are too flashy. Finally, a colorscheme that won't distract you from your code. Or your existential dread. It's not a bug, it's a feature; the feature is a lack of color.

*** Why?

Have you ever wondered why most syntax highlighting is about as subtle as a candy shop explosion? We have. So we fixed it. By removing most of the candy.

~nvim-256noir~ is a Lua port of the classic ~vim-256noir~ by =andreasvc= bring some [[https://github.com/andreasvc/vim-256noir][love]] here please!

*** Features

- Shades of gray for most things.
- Bright keywords to highlight structure. You get /some/ color.
- Dark comments & strings to emphasize surrounding code.
- Red for exceptional things (like constants & errors). Because some things demand attention.
- It's Lua. So it's fast. Probably.

*** Installation

Install with ~lazy.nvim~:

#+begin_src lua
{
  "padulkemid/nvim-256noir",
  lazy = false,
  priority = 1000,

  config = function()
    vim.cmd 'colorscheme 256noir'
  end,
}
#+end_src

Install with ~Intellij IDEA~:

#+begin_example
1. Goto `ext` folder and find `256noir.icls`.
2. Settings -> Appearance -> Import `256noir`.
#+end_example

This theme in ~Intellij IDEA~ is best paired with ~High Contrast~ default theme.

*** Usage

Set the colorscheme in your ~init.lua~:

#+begin_src lua
vim.cmd.colorscheme("256noir")
#+end_src

*** Configuration

None. You think we'd add options? That would be too colorful.
